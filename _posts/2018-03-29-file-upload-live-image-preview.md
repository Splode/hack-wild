It's a common practice today for users to contribute content by uploading images. A typical scenario is a user-submitted image for a profile photo selected using the `<input>` form element. Users have come to expect that when they select an image for uploading, they'll be able to preview the image before submitting it.

By default, when a user selects an image using the file `<input>` element, its reference is temporarily stored as a path; it needs to be read and processed before it can be shown onscreen.

We want users to be able to preview the image that they've selected before it's sent to a database or API endpoint. To accomplish this, we'll make use of the `FileReader` object, which is part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">File API</a>.

## Basic Setup

### Input and Image Elements

Our basic structure will be an image container with an empty `<img>` element and an `<input>` element with a type of `file`. To limit the file uploads to common image MIME types, we can use the `accept` attribute on the `<input>` element and pass in a list of acceptable file extensions. Lastly, we'll attach data attributes for JavaScript DOM targeting and a class for our image container.

```html
<div class="Preview-img">
  <img data-id="filePreview">
</div>
<input type="file" accept=".jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif" data-id="fileInput">
```

### Providing a few Basic Display Constraints with CSS

To ensure that our images fit within the confines of our layout, we'll use the `object-fit` property and set it to `cover`. This will crop all images to fit within its parent container, regardless of size or aspect ratio.

```scss
.Preview-img {
  background-color: gainsboro;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  & img {
    object-fit: cover;
    object-position: center;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
}
```

### Accessing the Elements in JavaScript

To handle when a user selects an image for upload, we'll attach an event listener to the `<input>` element with the `'change'` event. When a user selects a file, a reference to that file will be added to the `files` array on the `input` object. Each file element in this array holds information on the file, including filesize, MIME type, date modified, etc.

For now, we'll log the files attached to the input element.

```js
const filePreview = document.querySelector('img[data-id=filePreview]')
const fileInput = document.querySelector('input[data-id=fileInput]')

fileInput.addEventListener('change', handleFileUpload, false)

function handleFileUpload(inputEvent) {
  const input = inputEvent.target
  console.log(this.files)
}
```

## Using the FileReader Object

If we take a look at the log output after choosing an image file at this point, we'll see that `this.files` contains a `FileList` object with an array of `File` `Blob` objects (in this case, we'll only have one `File`). To read the data that the `File` represents and serve a preview of it, we'll need to use the `FileReader` object.

### Loading the Image Preview

The `FileReader` constructor returns a new `FileReader` object, which has several useful methods and events for handling file data. First, we'll use the `readAsDataURL()` method to read the content of the `File` object. The `readAsDataURL()` method will take in our `File` object as a `Blob` and return a result as a `DataURL`. Next, we'll hook into the `onload` event, which is fired when a read operation is successfully completed. When `onload` is fired, we'll set the `src` attribute of our `<img>` element to the FileReader result, which is the image `DataURL`.

Voila! Now we can preview our image as soon as we select it. ðŸ™Œ

```js
function handleFileUpload(inputEvent) {
  const input = inputEvent.target
  const reader = new FileReader()

  reader.readAsDataURL(input.files[0])
  reader.onload = readerEvent => {
    filePreview.src = readerEvent.target.result
  }
}
```

> Note that we're dealing with two different events here: the first event is the `<input>` 'change' event, while the second is the `FileReader` 'load' event.

### Image Type Validation

Setting the `accept` attribute on the file `<input>` element will limit the types of files that users can choose, but there are ways to circumvent this restriction. If the uploaded files are going to be sent to a database, we want to ensure that we are sending the right file type. To provide a second level of validation we can perform a MIME type check at the time the file is handled.

The `File` object attached to the `<input>` element has a `type` property with a `String` value corresponding to the file's MIME type. When we handle the file, we can check this property against a list of valid MIME types and only continue processing the file if it is in an accepted format. To do this, we'll define an array of MIME type strings and check if the `type` value matches an array element.

```js
const filePreview = document.querySelector('img[data-id=filePreview]')
const fileInput = document.querySelector('input[data-id=fileInput]')
const validImgFormats = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif']

fileInput.addEventListener('change', handleFileUpload, false)

function handleFileUpload(inputEvent) {
  const input = inputEvent.target
  const reader = new FileReader()

  if (validImgFormats.indexOf(input.files[0].type) === -1) {
    return alert(
      'Please provide a valid image file. Accepted formats include .png, .jpg, and .gif.'
    )
  }

  reader.readAsDataURL(input.files[0])
  reader.onload = readerEvent => {
    filePreview.src = readerEvent.target.result
  }
}
```

## Wrapping Up

We can now show a live preview of images that are selected with file `<input>` form elements. What if we wanted to allow multiple simoultaneous image uploads along with a preview for each image? That's a simple as adding the `multiple` attribute to the `<input>` element and iterating through the returned `FileList`.
