I"w<p>It’s a common practice today for users to contribute content by uploading images. A typical scenario is a user-submitted image for a profile photo selected using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;input&gt;</code> form element. Users have come to expect that when they select an image for uploading, they’ll be able to preview the image before submitting it.</p>
