I"ø<p>I recently found out about semantic Git commit messagesâ€”a method for structuring Git commits into logical chunks by using semantic labels. Inspired by <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karmaâ€™s style guide</a> for Git commit messages, the following semantic Git commits can greatly improve your Git log readability at a glance. They help to clarify the record of changes to a project and help focus commits into scoped segments.</p>
