Pairing `git log` with clear and meaningful commit messages

By itself, the `log` command shows quite a bit of information, including the full commit hash, author name and email, date, full commit message, etc.

## Generate Basic Release Notes

In the following example, we use `git log` to generate a list of commits that can be used in release notes. We pass the `--oneline` formatting flag to denote that we want a condensed version of each commit intended to fit one commit per line. We donâ€™t want to display all the commits, only the commits between the previous release and this upcoming release. We can limit the range of the log by using the `revision range` argument.

```git
$ git log --oneline v0.7.0...v0.7.1

0cee78d style: updates in various md posts
a5ad3d1 chore(deps): upgrade various deps
3bee705 feat: remove google analytics script
33e1a8a update: remove shell prompt symbol in jekyll-vue post code blocks
007595b feat: adjust styling of code blocks in post
9a3c41f chore: upgrade node-sass
e5df77a feat: add hero image alt text field to post
91b98b5 fix: set image max width
```

A benefit of generating release notes in this way is that GitHub will hyperlink commit hashes in release notes to the actual commit. This provides a convenient way to navigate to different points in a codebase's history.

### Customize Log Format

The output from `git log` can be customized in a number of ways.

Formatting the output involves passing the `--format` flag along with a formatting string.

```git
$ git log --format="- %h %s"

## Shortlog

The `shortlog` command is especially useful when generating release notes for projects with numerous collaborators. `shortlog` groups commits by author, sorted alphabetically by default.

```git
$ git shortlog -n --format="- %h %s" v0.7.1...v0.8.0

## Conclusion

I've found that this approach, when paired with meaningful commit messages, can be used to build consistent and helpful documentation for projects. It provides a clear path for collaborators (and you) to navigate the changes associated with a codebase in a given period of time. It's also flexible in that it the `log` output can be formatted any number of ways, and the process can be automated in various workflows.
